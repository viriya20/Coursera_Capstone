    "#### The data used for this study was obtained from Seattle's Department of Transportation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used is from Seattle's Collision GIS (Geographic Information System), a computer system used for capturing, storing and displaying data related to positions on Earth's surface. The data is from 2004 to the present and contains various features such as location, the severity of the collision, number of vehicles/cyclists/pedestrians involved, date/time of incident, weather, road conditions and more. There are almost 200,000 collisions in the dataset and 38 features. While some of the features won't be useful or have many missing values, the ones that I will explore in more detail will be:\n",
    "* Severity Code - this will be the target that we'll compare the features' impact on.\n",
    "* Severity Description - description of the severity codes.\n",
    "* X and Y values (coordinates) - are there areas where collisions are more concentrated?\n",
    "* Address Type - alley, block or intersection of collision.\n",
    "* Collision Type - 10 types of collisions such as parked car, angles, rear end, pedestrian, etc.\n",
    "* Person Count - # of people involved in collision.\n",
    "* Pedestrian Count - # of pedestrians involved in collision.\n",
    "* Cyclist Count - # of cyclists involved in collision.\n",
    "* Vehicle count - # of vehicles involved in collision.\n",
    "* Date/Time - are number of or severity of collisions more likely to occur on certain days or times?\n",
    "* Junction Type - 7 types describing collision at intersection, mid-block, driveway and whether collision is related to intersection.\n",
    "* Seattle Collision Code - Seattle codes to describe each collision.\n",
    "* Seattle Collision Description - description of Seattle collision codes.\n",
    "* Under Influence - was alcohol or drugs involved?\n",
    "* Weather - do more collisions occur because of adverse weather?\n",
    "* Road Conditions - do more collisions occur because of adverse road conditions?\n",
    "* Light Conditions - do more collisions occur because of adverse light conditions?\n",
    "* State Collision Code - 84 codes the state uses to descibe each collision.\n",
    "* State Collision Description - description of state collision codes.\n",
    "* Hit Parked Car - was a parked car involved in the collision?\n"
